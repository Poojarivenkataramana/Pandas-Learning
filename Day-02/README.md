## 📌 What is a Series?

A Series is a one-dimensional labeled array in Pandas that stores a single column of data.

### Example

```python
import pandas as pd

s = pd.Series([10, 20, 30, 40])
print(s)
```

---

## 📌 What is a DataFrame?

A DataFrame is a two-dimensional table with rows and columns, similar to an Excel sheet or SQL table.

### Example

```python
import pandas as pd

data = {
    "Name": ["Ram", "Sita", "Rahul"],
    "Age": [22, 21, 24]
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)
print(df)
```

---

## 📌 Data Selection

### Single Row Selection

```python
df.loc[0]
```

### Multiple Row Selection

```python
df.loc[[0, 1, 2]]
```

---

## 📌 `loc[]`

- Label-based indexing.
- Uses row and column labels.

```python
df.loc[0, "Name"]
```

---

## 📌 `iloc[]`

- Position-based indexing.
- Uses row and column positions.

```python
df.iloc[0, 1]
```

- DataFrame
- Single Row Selection
- Multiple Row Selection
- `loc[]`
- `iloc[]`

## 📚 Day 2 Summary

Today I learned how to create and work with Pandas Series and DataFrames. I also explored different ways to select rows and columns using `loc[]` and `iloc[]`, which are essential for data analysis.
